## 1. BackGround

### 1) 3D Representation

> | Depth Map | Voxel Grid | PointCloud |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | ![alt text](/assets/img/post/computer_vision/depth_map.png) | ![alt text](/assets/img/post/computer_vision/voxel.png)<br>![alt text](/assets/img/post/computer_vision/3dcnn.png) | ![alt text](/assets/img/post/computer_vision/point_cloud.png) | 
> | Distance between the camera and pixels | Represented as a 3D Grid | Represented as a "collection" of points<br> _(Volume: X, Location: O)_ |
> | (+) Can utilize 2D images | (+) Conceptually easy to understand| (+) Can represent structures<br> $\quad$ with a small number of points |
> | (-) Difficult to perform 3D tasks | (-) Requires a lot of memory for detailed<br>$\;\;\;$ representation.<br>$\;\;\;$_(3D Kernel $\rightarrow$ 3D CNN usage)_| (-) Cannot represent surfaces<br> (-) Needs a new type of Loss<br>$\;\;\;$ _(Because it's a "collection" of points)_ |
>
> | Mesh | Implicit Surface |
> | --- | --- |
> | ![alt text](/assets/img/post/computer_vision/mesh.png) | ![alt text](/assets/img/post/computer_vision/implicit_surface.png) |
> | A "collection" of triangles made up of "vertices" and "faces"<br> ● Vertices: Corners of the triangles<br> ● Face: Surface of the triangle | A method of representing 3D shapes as functions |
> | (+) Mainly used in Computer Graphics<br> (+) Adaptive representation is possible by using<br> $\quad$ more faces where detailed representation is needed<br> (+) Can also represent additional information such as<br> $\quad$ color and texture using things like UV Maps | (+) Can represent detailed surfaces |
> | (-) Not easy to handle in Neural Networks<br> $\quad$ _(Graph Convolution)_ | (-) Requires understanding of the concept |

## 2. Proposal

### 1) Challenges

> #### 1) Unordered
>
> Network must invariant to N! Permutation<br>
>
> **<u>It means that Network must always predict the same output, even though the order of point cloud is changed</u>**
>
> ---
> #### 2) Interaction among Points
>
> Model needs to be able to capture Local/Global structures
>
> **<u>Even though point cloud is kind of sets, It must be able to interact with surrounding points</u>**
>
> ---
> #### 3) Invariance under transformations
> 
> Learned representation of the point set should be invariant to certain transformation.
>
> **<u>It means that Network must always predict the same output, even though the point cloud is changed with rigid transformation</u>**<br>
> ※ rigid transformation: rotation, translation
> 

### 2) Solution(1) - Symmetric Function

Target Challenges

| Symmetric Function | _ | _ |


> #### Method1: Sort by Canonical order (X)
>
> We can sort point clouds before entering them into the network
> 
> $\rightarrow$ but we can't make stable network with point perturbation.
> 
> ---
> #### Method2: RNN with augment (X)
>
> we can use augmentation that allows RNN model to consider all permutatiopn orders
>
> $\rightarrow$ but we can't use if we have thousands of input
>
> ---
> #### Method3: Use Symmetric Function (O)
>
> we can approximate our network to a symmetric funtion
> 
> | Theory(Hausdorff Distance) | Application |

> Author stated that using maxpooling as a symmetric function is the best way, because it can make our network learn the critical points of point clouds
